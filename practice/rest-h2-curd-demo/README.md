# rest-h2-curd-demo

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: <https://quarkus.io/>.

PanacheEntityBase: provides inbuilt methods for curd operations.

PanacheEntity: provides inbuilt methods for curd operations and id.

## Active Record Pattern 

Keeping business login in resource class itslef and it is not recommended for production only use for POC

User's and Employee's api implementations

## Resource Pattern

Keep businesss login in service layer, repository, resouce, dto, entity.... etc

Person's api implementations

## Application Development

```shell script
1. Open https://quarkus.io/ in browser
   group: com.rk.quarkus
   artifacts: rest-h2-curd-demo
   build: maven
   version: ***
   Java version: ***
   Starter Code: Yes

   Search extentions: web
          select quarkus-rest, quarkus-rest-jackson, quarkus-jdbc-h2, quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache
   Generate your apploication and download zip file.
   Extract it and extracted content contains many file. just copy src and pom file
   Import projet into STS IDE.
```

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/rest-h2-curd-demo-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling>.
